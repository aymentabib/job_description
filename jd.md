Working on embedded systems since 2008, my first project was a PABX based on SLIC and a PIC MCU. 
With this first experience I learned basic and major skills, like how to design and implement state machines, 
and the importance to decouple firmware source code from Hardware and how this can help to test, debug and improve developement time.

I discovered the stm32, arduino , and raspberry Pi in the university, when I supervised many projects related to iot and robotics.
The first big project with stm32 was an OBD devices based on stm32F4 MCU and the M66 gsm module, this project was an important milestone in my career,
I learned,
- how to desing HW for manufacturing and advanced Altium features to obtain a modular design, 
- new git features like submodules, 
- the importance of code refactoring to keep the code clean and  reusable,

In my curent position at Wattnow, 
- how to implement FOTA with the safest and best  way to do it.
- more experience to write modular code and design the firmware architecture.
- advanced experience  mqtt with Paho lib.
- advanced experience with low power design.
